# Database sharding

This directory will contain the markdown documents for the database sharding so
they can easily be reffered to. The database backend is `Mongodb`. Next to the
architecture of the database itself, some backend changes will also be required.
Most notably, the collections which will be sharded will require an additional field
to be used as the shard key.

For a high level overview of the proposed changes, see
[high_level_design.md](high_level_design.md)

Normal operation data flow: [dataflow.md](dataflow.md)



To deploy an example setup, [a shell script is provided](deploy_shards.sh). This
script deploys: a 3 member config replica set, a 3 member primary shard replica set,
and a 3 member secondary shard replica set. It also deploys a `mongos` instance, with
port `27017` exposed on localhost, linked to the created shards. If a `dump` directory
is present in the same directory as the script file, it will try to restore the dump.
The script then modifies the database and sets up the user collection for sharding.
To remove the dockers, run the script with `clean` as first argument
 (`./deploy_shards clean`).
