# Scopes that can be requested by an oauth client

## `user:memberof:<globalid>`

A client can check if a user is member or owner of an organization with a specific globalid.
Itsyou.online checks if the user is indeed member or owner and the user needs to confirm
that the requesting client is allowed to know that he/she is part of the organization.

If the user is no member of the <globalid> organization, the oauth flow continues but the scope will not be available. This scope can be requested multiple times.
